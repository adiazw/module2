<p>
The fountains mingle with the river<br>
And the rivers with the ocean,<br>
The winds of heaven mix for ever<br>
With a sweet emotion;<br>
Nothing in the world is single;<br>
All things by a law divine<br>
In one spirit meet and mingle.<br>
Why not I with thine?&#8212;
<!-- A passionate plea by Shelley. This reminds me of John Donne's attempts at romantic persuasion in his works. -->
<!-- In truth I considered his poem 'The Flea' for this assignment but the indentations of his poems are a headache. Sorry, Mr. Donne.-->
</p>
<p>
See the mountains kiss high heaven<br>
And the waves clasp one another;<br>
No sister-flower would be forgiven<br>
If it disdained its brother;<br>
And the sunlight clasps the earth<br>
And the moonbeams kiss the sea:<br>
What is all this sweet work worth<br>
<i>If thou kiss not me?</i>

<!-- The first stanza flowed through a scene, but this one leans hard into dualities. -->
<!-- It adds specificity to the theme of connection, plus romantic connotations, and all but spells it out for his potential lover.-->
